                  <p>Jasmine, happy birthday! A battle axe for the Lord, a woman of the word and the spirit, considerate, kind, and sympathetic, one who shares burdens and bears them. And now I give you my praise to God and to the word of His grace, which has the power to uplift you and to grant you a place among the sanctified. I wish you well and God bless you po always!</p>
